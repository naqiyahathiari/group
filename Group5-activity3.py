# program Description:-

- Python script designed to handle CSV files...
It contains 4 primary functions: Load Data; Clean and prepare data; Analyze data; Visualize and present the data.

- User enters the file path however if it doesn't exist an error message is provided...
Now the file is processed for each stage step by step.

- There are columns in the file: Branch / Product / Price / Units sold...
For the 'Price' column, it calculates the minimum/maximum/average of non-empty cells, replaces empty cells with this average, and prints the updated data...
Similarly, for the 'Units sold' column, it calculates the minimum/maximum/average and replaces empty cells.
These operations ensure data integrity by handling empty values appropriately, enhancing the accuracy of subsequent analysis.

* The file cursor is used to reset file pointer to the beginning of the CSV file, and the file is updated with the replacement values...
after that, the data is restructured into its original format and printed to the console, ensuring consistency.

- Next step is the process of sorting the data in the selected column ('Price' or 'Units sold') either in ascending or descending order...
It first confirms the column selected by the user ('Price' or 'Units sold'). Then, it asks the user to choose the sorting order: ascending or descending...
After getting the user's input, the code implements the insertion sort algorithm to sort the data accordingly...
For ascending order, it compares each element with the previous ones and moves it to the correct position...
Likewise, for descending order, it compares each element with the previous ones and moves it to the correct position accordingly.

- Once the sorting is done, it replaces the original column data with the sorted values. Finally, it prints the updated table with the sorted column values.
This functionality enhances the data analysis capability by allowing users to sort the data in the selected column in either ascending or descending order, facilitating easier interpretation and analysis.
Lastly, the 'analyze_data' function updates the CSV file with the sorted data and displayes the updated table.

- Finally, 'visualize_data' function checks the selected column, processes the data, and displays it using asterisks...
The function gracefully handles non-numeric values and relies on robust file handling for accurate visualization.

"""

# csv module is imported to ease the use of 'comma separated value' files
import csv

# After stage 2, 'PROCESSED_COLUMN' list (constant) aids in maintaing the selected column in stage 3 and 4.
PROCESSED_COLUM = []

# the 'load_data' function takes a parameter 'csvfile' (for user input)
def load_data(csvfile):
    '''
this function opens the selected CSV file, after that the CSV reader attribute is initialized as a variable called 'reader'.
The file is passed as an argument to 'reader', then the function checks if the file exists using 'try' and 'except' FileNotFoundError.
If the file is found (existing), then the function prints the contents of the CSV file to the console with a feedback message indicating successfull loading.
    '''
    # open the csv file using 'with open' that opens the file to perform operations and then close it back instead of using file.open() and file.close()
    with open(csvfile) as file:
        # initialize a 'reader' object using 'csv.reader()' method
        reader = csv.reader(file)
        # skipping the headers will affect the way the file looks, hence leading to false informaiton (SemanticError)
        '''
        next(reader)
        '''
        # print the contents of the file
        for line in reader:
            print(line)
        print("\nFile successfully loaded!")
        
# again, the 'clean_and_prepare_data' function takes a pramater 'csvfile' (for user input)
def clean_and_prepare_data(csv_file):
    '''
The "clean_and_prepare_data" function facilitates data cleaning and preparation for a selected column in a CSV file.
It first prompts the user to choose from available columns, ensuring a valid selection.

If the chosen column contains numerical data (i.e., 'Price' or 'Units sold')...
it offers options to replace empty values with either the minimum, maximum, or average of the existing data.

After validating the operation selection, it executes the chosen operation to handle empty values in the column.
Once completed, the function confirms the successful replacement of empty values.

Overall, clean_and_prepare_data guides users through the process of selecting and preparing a column, enhancing the data's integrity for subsequent analysis.
    '''
    def minimum(csv_file):
        '''
this function is designed to find the minimum from the selected column in a CSV file.
it will substitute the empty cells with the minimum value found.

Initially, it first checks to whether the chosen column is either 'Price' or 'Unites sold'...
then it performs next step which is replacing the minimum value in the selected column in the file.

The replacement process is implemented as follows:-

- It indicates minimum value in the 'Price' column (if selected) and replaces all empty cells with the value.
- Likewise, if the selected column is 'Units sold', it finds the least value in the column and then populates the empty cells with the information.

Upon completion, it prints the updated table which includes the empty cells that are replaced.
This function makes use of file handling consistently to perform the algorithm tasks exclusively.

file.seek(0) is used to move the file cursor (the position from where the next read or write operation will occur) to the beginning of the file before iterating over the file contents again.

Without file.seek(0), if you try to read the file again without closing and reopening it, you'll be at the end of the file.

So, basically it resets the cursor to the beginning of the file before re-reading it.

The maximum function is designed to find the maximum value from the selected column in a CSV file and substitute any empty cells with this maximum value.
Initially, it checks whether the chosen column is either 'Price' or 'Units sold'. Then, it proceeds to find and replace the maximum value in the selected column in the file.

The replacement process is executed as follows:-

- It identifies the maximum value in the 'Price' column (if selected) and replaces all empty cells with this value.
- Similarly, if the selected column is 'Units sold', it locates the maximum value in the column and fills the empty cells with this information.

Upon completion, the function prints the updated table, showcasing the replaced empty cells with their respective maximum values.
Throughout its execution, this function relies on consistent file handling techniques to perform the algorithmic tasks effectively and accurately.

        '''
The average function works in the same manner as the others, finding the average value of the column the user selects to replace any empty cells with this average value.
Primarily, it makes sure that the selected column is either the 'Price' or 'Units sold'...
Then, it moves over to do the averaging calculation of the cells and substitutes the empty ones with the average values from the column in the source file.

The replacement process unfolds as follows:-

- If the user selects 'Price' as the column, it calculates the average of all non-empty cell's value in the column and replaces the cells without data with this number.
- Likewise, when the selected column is "Units sold", it fills the empty cells with this average value of the non-empty cells.

Upon completion, the function outputs the processed table, demonstrating the replaced cells, which now contain their average value.
File handling techniques are often used to perform the neccessary algorithms of this function deliberately and accurately.

At the inception, it decides whether the chosen column is 'Price' or 'Units sold'. Next, column is sorted according to the selected operation happens...
based on the column selection by user such as 'Price' or 'Units sold', the function processes and sorts data chips from the CSV file.

the function then asks the user to enter the preferred opration:-

- Ascending order (operation)
- Descending order (operation)

In the sorting process, it uses the insertion sort algorithm to organize it either in ascending or descending order, depending on the preferences.
The function takes user's input for sorting the order, and then it sorts data as per their input.

When sorting process finishes, the function replaces values in CSV file with the sorted entries...
It swaps the content of the original column with the sorted values of the file...
After sorting the selected column in the CSV file, the function prints the sorted values with updated table by printing to the console.

During its run time, the analyze_data function repeatedly utilizes regular file handling approaches to deal with the CSV file and meet user criteria...
where appropriate item classification takes place.

    def insertion_sort(column_data):

The insertion_sort function allows for the insertion sort algorithm to sort data within a CSV file in either the ascending or the descending sequence as requested by the user.
Primarily, it checks if the option column is just either 'Price' or 'Units sold'. Next it will contrive the structure by just selecting the column which will support the data ordering.

In the sorting process, it takes a form of insertion sort to look at every element and put them in the proper order (selected by user) through comparison...
The sorting function of the program supports the sorting operations that are done in both ascending and descending order which depends on the preference of the user...
lastly it will print the updated table, displaying the sorted values to the console.

Upon execution of the function, file handling methods are used that reads and writes data to CSV files, resulting in the implementation of sorting columns of the CSV file according to the user's selection.

First, the algorithm checks if the last-selected column is either 'Price' or 'Units sold' and develops an algorithm that visualizes the nuerical values in the selected column...
after identification the selected column, the function executes the visualization of the data from the previously selected column.

The visualization process is completed by iterating through the CSV file repeatedly...
and if the column 'Price' is previously selected, then it projects/prints the data as a visual e.g. the asterisk (*) character...
after that, the function prints a goodbye message.

Execution of the function is practical in non-numeric cases too, letting the user know those values which were skipped...
After the completion, it exhibits the specified data in the form of visualized charts to the user for analysis and review.
